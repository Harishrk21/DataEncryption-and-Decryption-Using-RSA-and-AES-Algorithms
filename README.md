# Hybrid Encryption for Android: Protecting Image and Text Data

## Overview

In today's digital landscape, protecting digital assets is crucial. Our project introduces a hybrid encryption approach tailored for Android platforms, focusing on image and text data security. By combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques, we offer a robust defense against unauthorized access.

## Features

- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines AES (symmetric) and RSA (asymmetric) algorithms for enhanced security.
- **Image and Text Data Protection**: Encrypts and decrypts images and text data with ease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for seamless data encryption and decryption.

## Encryption Approach

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Provides fast and efficient encryption of data.
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: Ensures secure key management by encrypting the AES keys.

## Usage

1. **Select Data**: Choose the image or text file you wish to encrypt.
2. **Encrypt Data**: Use the app's encryption feature to secure your data.
3. **Decrypt Data**: Easily decrypt your data when needed.

## Security Considerations

- **Symmetric Encryption (AES)**: Fast and suitable for large data volumes.
- **Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)**: Secure key management, protecting encryption keys from unauthorized access.

## Compatibility

- Designed for Android platforms.
- Compatible with a wide range of Android devices.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional encryption algorithms.
- Enhanced user interface and experience.
- Performance optimizations for large files.
- Expanding to other platforms like iOS.
